## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict **customer churn** for a bank. The model evaluates customer data and predicts the probability of a customer leaving.  

The live Streamlit app allows users to **input customer details** and receive real-time churn probability predictions.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- Interactive **Streamlit interface** for real-time predictions.
- Calculates **churn probability** and provides actionable insights.
- Handles **categorical variables** via **one-hot encoding** and **label encoding**.
- Automatically **scales numerical features** for better ANN performance.
- User-friendly input for testing different customer profiles.
