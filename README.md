## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn for a bank. By analyzing customer data, the model estimates the probability of a customer leaving the bank.  

The model is trained using features like credit score, geography, gender, balance, tenure, number of products, and more.

You can test the live app here: [Customer Churn Prediction App](https://ann-classification-churn2025.streamlit.app/)
